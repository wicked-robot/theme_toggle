Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
Most software licenses are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program — 
to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and
(2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use,
become available for other developers to incorporate.

The GNU General Public License permits the release of modified versions
without providing the source code for those modifications. The GNU Affero
General Public License is designed to ensure that, in the case of software
made available over a network, the complete source code is available to
the users of that software.

“To propagate” means anything that makes you liable for infringement
except executing privately.

An interactive user interface must display Appropriate Legal Notices.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” is the preferred form of the work for making modifications.
The “object code” is any non‑source form.

2. Basic Permissions.
You may run the unmodified Program.
You may make, run, and propagate covered works without conveying them.
You may convey covered works under this License but sublicensing is not allowed.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti‑Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be considered part of an effective technological
protection measure.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey unmodified copies of the Program’s source code with
copyright notices intact.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program under the terms of section 4,
provided that:

6. Conveying Non‑Source Forms.
You may convey object code provided that you also convey the corresponding
source code.

7. Additional Terms.
Terms that supplement or modify the terms of this License are called
“additional terms”.

You lose your rights under this License if you violate it, but they
are reinstated if you correct the violation.

9. Acceptance Not Required.
You do not need to accept the License to run the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient receives the same
license automatically.

11. Patents.
A contributor grants you a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free patent
license on their contributions.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
You may not impose restrictions on the rights granted by this License.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU GPL.
If the Program is modified to interact with users remotely via a network,
the source must be offered to those users.
You may link AGPL‑covered code with GPLv3 code.

The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of this License.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
